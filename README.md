Examples in python to generate and visualize statistic distributions. Also they show how to make hypotesis tests. <br/>
This is done only with NumPy, pandas, sklearn and scipy libraries. matplotlib and seaborn are used to plot graphics.
<br/>
The examples are presented as jupyter notebooks:
- [Generation and visualization of statistic distributions](distributions.ipynb)
- [Normality tests techniques](normality.ipynb)(Shapiro-Wilk & Anderson-Darling)
- [z-tests](z-tests.ipynb) and [t-tests](t-tests.ipynb) (for hypothesis testing)
- [chi-square test](chisquare-tests.ipynb)(goodness of fit test)
