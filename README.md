Examples in python to generate and visualize statistic distributions. Also they show how to make hypotesis tests. <br/>
This is done only with NumPy, pandas, sklearn and scipy libraries. matplotlib and seaborn are used to plot graphics.
<br/>
The examples are presented as jupyter notebooks:
- [Generation and visualization of statistic distributions](distributions.ipynb)
- [Normality tests techniques (Shapiro-Wilk & Anderson-Darling)](normality.ipynb)
- [t-tests (unpaired, one-sample and paired)](t-tests.ipynb)
- [chi-square test (goodness of fit test)](chisquare-tests.ipynb)
